ruby 2.4.4p296 (2018-03-28 revision 63013) [x86_64-linux]

how to do I update my version of ruby so that I can
use docs that refer to the version 2.5.1 core

Read the docs
Try out the method in irb using a few different values
Once you feel like you understand how it works, write down
its arguments (name, data type, optional/required, default value if any)
its return type
Write an example (in code) of how to use the method
run your code to make sure your example is valid!

[STRING]
length(String)- .length
  returns an integer that reps the # of characters in a string

strip (.strip)
  returns copy of the string with leading/trailing whitespace removed
split (string) - .split
  returns an array; you can pass an argument that represents a delimiter, that will
  be used to break the string into an array
start_with?
  returns a boolean; will return true of the string starts with one of the
  prefixes given


[ARRAY]
  first
    returns an object or nil; will return the first element or the first 'n'
    elements of the ARRAY

  delete_at
    returns an object or nil; you pass the requested index of the array as an argument
    and at that specific index, it will delete the element, or return nil if the index is out of
    range
  delete(obj)
    accepts an object as an argument, and will return all items from self (the array) that match
    the object that is passed as an argument; you can also provide an optional code block in curly braces
    to be displayed if the object to be deleted is not found in the array
  pop
    will remove the last element from the array, and return the that element- returns nil is the array
    is empty

[HASH]

    to_a
      returns an array- converts hash to a nested array of [key, value] arrays
has_key?
  returns boolean; returns true if the given key is present in the hash
  pass the key as an argument to check
has_value?
  returns boolean; will return true is the given value is present for some key in a hash
  pass the value as the argument to check

[TIME]

  now
    creates a new instance of the time object for the current time
    returns the time

[FILE]
    exist?
      pass a file_name as the argument and it will return a boolean value of either
      true or false depending on whether the named file exists or not
    extname
      pass a path as the argument it will return a string; returns the extension
      (the portion of the file name in path starting from the last period)
